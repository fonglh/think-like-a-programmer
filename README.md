Solutions from going through Think Like A Programmer by V. Anton Spraul

## Build and Run

```
$ go build
$ ./think-like-a-programmer
```

## Converting to Go Modules

This repository was first created before Go modules became compulsory.

To run this with Go 1.17 onwards, it was necessary to initialize it as a Go module with the following command:

```
go mod init github.com/fonglh/think-like-a-programmer
```
